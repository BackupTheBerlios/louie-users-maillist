Message-ID: <20060130195851.CEDE6313DBE@localhost.localdomain>

Louie 1.1 is available:

<http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/Louie>

Louie provides Python programmers with a straightforward way to
dispatch signals between objects in a wide variety of contexts. It is
based on PyDispatcher_, which in turn was based on a highly-rated
recipe_ in the Python Cookbook.
