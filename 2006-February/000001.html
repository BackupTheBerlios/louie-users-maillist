<PRE>To recap for those who might be scanning the list archives, the plugin
system prior to 1.1 had a minor problem in that if you called install_plugin
multiple times the nested method weakrefs would croak.  There was a fix in
1.1 and perhaps a tweak in 1.2 (I am not sure about the last bit) and
current behavior seems to be that if you call install_plugin multiple times
you will get a PluginTypeError.

I am not sure I necessarily agree about raising an exception for multiple
calls to install_plugin but I can see the logic behind the choice and it is
easy enough to wrap the call to install_plugin in a try/except clause.
While I was thinking about the reasoning behind the exception I started to
consider the plugin issue a bit more and realized that there was an
interesting set of wierdnesses lurking beneath the surface.  For someone who
controls their app from top to bottom things are fairly clear on what to do,
but what about the case where the coder is responding to signals from
another module/framework?

If I install, for example, the twisted plugin then the returns from my
signal sends will be deferreds.  Simple enough. The wierdness arises if I am
using louie in my app, I do not have the twisted plugin installed, and I
import a package that also uses louie but which installs the twisted
plugin.  Suddenly my signals that are passing around independantly of this
other package start returning deferreds...

I guess what I am leading towards is the question of whether or not the
sender of the signal should define how that send() call returns rather than
a global value (e.g. the list of installed plugins) so that no one gets
caught unaware when processing the results of a louie.send()?  Perhaps
installing a plugin should just make a send_with_deferred_return() available
rather than forcing the wrapper on all calls?

Regards,

Jim
