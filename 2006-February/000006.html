</I>
I'll let Pat O'Brien (the originator of the PyDispatcher recipe in the 
cookbook) chime in with his two cents, but here is what inspired us to 
branch from PyDispatcher, in rough order of importance:

* Package name conflicts -- we were using both PyDispatcher and 
RuleDispatch in Schevo.  Ultimately, we ended up embedding PyDispatcher 
in the Schevo namespace.  The name &quot;Louie&quot; may be new but its roots 
actually go back to that fork.

* Naming -- we prefer short names when possible.  Louie was a nice 
obscure reference to dispatching, is easy to type, and was not taken. 
We further collapsed the namespace so one just has to use &quot;import louie&quot; 
and then call &quot;louie.whatever(...)&quot; for the entire public API.

* Plugins -- we ran into problems using PyDispatcher with PyQt, where it 
would attempt to call receivers on dead QWidget instances.  It seemed 
the best way to do this would be to start a plugin system of sorts. 
Later, when I started working with the Nufox project, I found I needed 
to create a plugin for Louie to work with Twisted.  Thus, the primitive 
state of the current Louie plugin mechanism, which hasn't been extended 
beyond the &quot;works here&quot; criteria.

* easy_install -U Louie, and install_requires=['Louie&gt;=1.0']  :)

* SourceForge is notoriously slow.

* Using CVS is more painful than more modern repository systems.

* Code formatting -- the code originating from PyDispatcher was 
reformatted to have better docstrings, consistent whitespace, and 
four-space indentation.

* We wanted to revive a project that had reached a plateau of sorts. 
Because there are so many other bullet points described above, the most 
efficient way to do so seemed to be to create a new project that was a 
fork of PyDispatcher.
