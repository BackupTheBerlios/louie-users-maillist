<PRE>Someone on the wx.Python list recently pointed me to Louie -- I've taken a
closer look at it now and the one thing that kind of bothers me is that it
uses a central global dispatcher.  The thing I was looking for was an
alternative to wx.lib.pubsub that doesn't pull in all of wx as a
dependency.  But in some ways wx.lib.pubsub makes more sense to me.  There a
publisher talks directly to a subscriber without a middle man.  If you want
A to signal B, A creates a Publisher, and B can connect to A's Publisher.
Of course if you want to make a big global publisher and have everyone use
it, you can do that too.  Louie seems to force the &quot;big global publisher&quot;
paradigm on you.

The stuff in louie.dispatcher is fairly compact, and looks like it could
easily be encapsulated in a class if one wanted to.  I think all you need is
to make these globals non-global:
  connections = {}
  senders = {}
  senders_back = {}
  plugins = []
and put them in a Dispatcher class.  Is there any reason not to have such a
class?  louie.dispatcher could still have the module level functions, they
would just use an on-demand instantiated module-level instance of
Dispatcher.

Or maybe someone can convince me that my concerns are unfounded and I should
just go with the one big happy global dispatcher.
