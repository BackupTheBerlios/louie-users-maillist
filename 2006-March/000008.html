<PRE>Hi,

First of thanks for creating louie, it's proven to be a drop dead easy
mechanism to handle events (I originally tried zope.component but that
has a couple of things stopping me from using it, no weakref support
and a less flexible means of defining signals and handlers on the
fly).

I just have a couple of minor questions:

* Where did the louie svn go? There is a link to svn on berlios but
that seems to have been disabled.

* The louie site seems to missing some of the docs that are available
in the distribution. It's also missing some basic examples.

* Did anyone make any progress on handling sub classes or ruledispatch
signals? (This kinda leads into my where did the svn go question).

Also, I've created a modified twisted plugin which uses
reactor.callFromThread, which makes louie easy to use from inside
threaded calls:

class TwistedCallFromThreadPlugin(louie.Plugin):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;A twisted plugin which uses reactor.callFromThread

    This ensures thread safety, but it does mean that dispatch calls in louie
    never return anything useful.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def wrap_receiver(self, receiver):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            reactor.callFromThread(receiver, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper

This may be of some use to some people. This leads back to the
conversation on the  plugins system, I have a definite case where I
might want different behaviour depending on the context (e.g. twisted
safe deferred call vs a call from a thread).

cheers,
  Michael
