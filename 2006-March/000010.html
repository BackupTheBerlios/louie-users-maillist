No problem.

Thanks, this works for me.

&gt;<i> &gt; * The louie site seems to missing some of the docs that are available
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the distribution. It's also missing some basic examples.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, we are a bit behind on putting all the pieces together.  :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm seeing the docs in svn so you seem to have a lot of this done.

&gt;<i> &gt; * Did anyone make any progress on handling sub classes or ruledispatch
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signals? (This kinda leads into my where did the svn go question).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not yet.  Let me know if you'd like developer access to work on a branch
</I>&gt;<i> for this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not at the moment, I'm in the middle of a refactor so I can't think
anything else right now :) However, the refactor does involve louie so
I might have a few more ideas on this when I'm done.

I would like to have a stab at an experimental ruledispatch branch
just to see what that would look like. I don't know when I'd get time
to try that though.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the contribution.  Would you like to take the lead on the
</I>&gt;<i> plugin system?  Anyone else?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
At the moment I'm not hurting as much as I thought I would be with the
plugins, so I don't have any strong opinions on plugin design right
now.

cheers,
  Michael
