 I grabbed a tarball from:
    http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/Louie

 Is the cheeseshop considered the official release place?

        Hi there,

 I would like to prepare packages of Louie for Debian however the
 tarballs at http://louie.berlios.de/dist/ all return a 403 Forbidden
 when I try to get them.

 Would someone be so kind to fix the permissions on the tarballs or
 point me at the correct URL?

   Thanks!

Subject: [Louie-users] Objectifying dispatcher
Message-ID: <e86a5fd00706182357v48ce813dvc7d57f636bcaebf3@mail.gmail.com>

Someone on the wx.Python list recently pointed me to Louie -- I've taken a
closer look at it now and the one thing that kind of bothers me is that it
uses a central global dispatcher.  The thing I was looking for was an
alternative to wx.lib.pubsub that doesn't pull in all of wx as a
dependency.  But in some ways wx.lib.pubsub makes more sense to me.  There a
publisher talks directly to a subscriber without a middle man.  If you want
A to signal B, A creates a Publisher, and B can connect to A's Publisher.
Of course if you want to make a big global publisher and have everyone use
it, you can do that too.  Louie seems to force the "big global publisher"
paradigm on you.

The stuff in louie.dispatcher is fairly compact, and looks like it could
easily be encapsulated in a class if one wanted to.  I think all you need is
to make these globals non-global:
  connections = {}
  senders = {}
  senders_back = {}
  plugins = []
and put them in a Dispatcher class.  Is there any reason not to have such a
class?  louie.dispatcher could still have the module level functions, they
would just use an on-demand instantiated module-level instance of
Dispatcher.

Or maybe someone can convince me that my concerns are unfounded and I should
just go with the one big happy global dispatcher.
