I can understand why that may concern you.


&gt;<i> The thing I was looking for was an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to wx.lib.pubsub that doesn't pull in all of wx as a dependency.
</I>&gt;<i>  But in some ways wx.lib.pubsub makes more sense to me.  There a publisher
</I>&gt;<i> talks directly to a subscriber without a middle man.  If you want A to
</I>&gt;<i> signal B, A creates a Publisher, and B can connect to A's Publisher.  Of
</I>&gt;<i> course if you want to make a big global publisher and have everyone use it,
</I>&gt;<i> you can do that too.  Louie seems to force the &quot;big global publisher&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> paradigm on you.
</I>
Remember, Louie is ultimately based on
<A HREF="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/87056">http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/87056</A>
and is basically a fancy + bug-fixed version of that recipe.

Schevo has in the past used Louie for event dispatching for
auto-updated PyQt GUIs, but I don't know of other uses in the wild
(yet).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The stuff in louie.dispatcher is fairly compact, and looks like it could
</I>&gt;<i> easily be encapsulated in a class if one wanted to.  I think all you need is
</I>&gt;<i> to make these globals non-global:
</I>&gt;<i>   connections = {}
</I>&gt;<i>   senders = {}
</I>&gt;<i>   senders_back = {}
</I>&gt;<i>   plugins = []
</I>&gt;<i> and put them in a Dispatcher class.  Is there any reason not to have such a
</I>&gt;<i> class?  louie.dispatcher could still have the module level functions, they
</I>&gt;<i> would just use an on-demand instantiated module-level instance of
</I>&gt;<i> Dispatcher.
</I>
+1 for that -- then you get the best of both worlds.  If you post a
patch here we would be glad to review it and merge it in.


&gt;<i> Or maybe someone can convince me that my concerns are unfounded and I should
</I>&gt;<i> just go with the one big happy global dispatcher.
</I>
Questions: How many dispatchers do you envision using?  What makes it
a necessity to segregate them?
